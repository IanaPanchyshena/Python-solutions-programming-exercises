# Assume a file containing a series of names (as strings) is named names.txt
# and exists on the computerâ€™s disk.
# Write a program that displays the number of names that are stored in the file.
# (Hint: Open the file and read every string stored in it.
# Use a variable to keep a count of the number of items
# that are read from the file.)
