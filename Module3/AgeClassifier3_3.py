# AgeClassifier3_3

#Write a program that asks the user to enter a personâ€™s age.
#The program should display a message indicating
#whether the person is an infant, a child, a teenager, or an adult.
#Following are the guidelines:
    #If the person is 1 year old or less, he or she is an infant.
    #If the person is older than 1 year, but younger than 13 years, he or she is a child.
    #If the person is at least 13 years old, but less than 20 years old, he or she is a teenager.
    #If the person is at least 20 years old, he or she is an adult.

def main():
    # start program
    age=int(input('What is your age? '))
    if age<=1:
        print('You are an infant ')
    else:
        if age>1 and age<13:
            print('You are a child ')
        else:
            if age>13 and age<20:
                print('You are a teenager ')
            else:
